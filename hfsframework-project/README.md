# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.

You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version and runtime choice (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

```
./mvnw clean package wildfly:run
```
If you prefer to run the UI with redeployment support, please execute the following from this directory:
```
./mvnw wildfly:dev
```
Once the server is running, the source directories are monitored for changes. If required the sources will be compiled and the deployment may be redeployed.

Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-hello-world.
